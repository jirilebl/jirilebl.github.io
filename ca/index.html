<p>
The purpose of this book is to teach a one-semester graduate course in complex
analysis for incoming graduate students.  It was created to teach Math 5283
at Oklahoma State University, although it has more material than can be covered
in one semester.
The first seven chapters is a natural first
semester in a two semester sequence where the second semester could be several
complex variables or perhaps harmonic analysis. It could perhaps be used for a
more elementary two-semester sequence if the appendix (metric spaces, some
basic analysis) is covered first, and all the optional bits of the main text
are also covered.

<p>
We assume basic knowledge of undergraduate analysis
in the real variable, called advanced calculus in some schools. The text assumes
knowledge of metric spaces and differential calculus in several variables, but if the
reader is not confident on these topics or has not yet seen them, the useful results
are presented (with proofs) in the appendices. With that, a basic prerequisite for the
course would be at least a single semester of undergraduate analysis if the appendices
are also covered or read, and if the student has seen metric spaces and mappings in
\({\mathbb{R}}^2\), then the course can just start in Chapter 1.
Very basic undergraduate linear and
abstract algebra is also useful.

<p>
The first time I ran this one-semester course at OSU, I covered Chapters
1&ndash;6 (without the optional starred bits) and the first half of chapter 7.

<p>
This book may be modified and customized for a specific
purpose if necessary.  If you do modify the book, make sure to mark it
prominently as such to avoid confusion.  This aspect is also important for
longevity of the book.  The book can be updated and modified even if I happen
to drop off the face of the earth.  You do not have to depend on any publisher
being interested as with traditional textbooks.

<h2 id=youtubecourse>YouTube course and slides:</h2>
<p>
I have made a set of slides and a YouTube course to go with the book.
You may want to watch it fullscreen for the slides to be readable.
The core part that I normally cover in one semester (nonstarred bits of chapters 1 through 7) is complete.
I will slowly keep going to add all the non-starred bits, and possibly even some of the starred bits later on.
<p>
<span style="font-size:120%"><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRfQb6m35rf5vZaOlSXVmt0hgJepfEqCw">The playlist link</a></span> (to watch any particular lecture).

<p>
<b>The Slides:</b> <a href="slides.zip">as PDFs</a>.  Note that some of the slides have been slightly
improved since I recorded the lectures, so they might not match 100%.

<p>
The LaTeX source for the slides is available on github
in the <span class=tt>slides</span> subdirectory (see 
<a href="https://github.com/jirilebl/ca">https://github.com/jirilebl/ca</a> and see below).
Read the <span class=tt>README.md</span> file in that subdirectory.
If you want to rebuild them, make sure to
build them from that subdirectory to get the figures right,
or you'd have to modify the source and copy the
figures out of the <span class=tt>figures</span> subdirectory.
Feel free to modify and use them for your class, the license is the same as the book.

<h2>Source:</h2>
<p>
The LaTeX source is hosted on <b>GitHub</b>:
<a href="https://github.com/jirilebl/ca">https://github.com/jirilebl/ca</a>
<p>
You can get an archive of the source of the released version on github, look under
<a href="https://github.com/jirilebl/ca/releases">https://github.com/jirilebl/ca/releases</a>,
though if you plan to work with it, maybe best to look at just the current working version
(the master branch) to be more up to date, though at times this might be a work in progress if
I am working on some new material.  Perhaps best let me know if you want to make modifications.
<p>
The main file is
<span class=tt>ca.tex</span>.  I compile the pdf with <span class=tt>pdflatex</span>.  You also want
to run <span class=tt>makeindex</span> to generate the index
and <span class=tt>makeglossaries</span> to generate the glossary of used notation
(and then rerun <span class=tt>pdflatex</span> a couple of times, I repeat this
whole thing 4 times just to be sure: see <span class=tt>publish.sh</span>
script).
<p>
The slides mentioned above are in the <span class=tt>slides</span> subdirectory.
The slides are more of a work in progress so best to get these out of the
current github.
<p>
The github 'master' version is the current working version,
so it will have whatever new changes I make in my tree.
