<h1>Notes on Diffy Qs: Differential Equations for Engineers: Changes</h1>

<p>
<b>August 6th 2025 edition, Version 6.9 (edition 6, 9th update):</b>
<p>

The main focus of this edition is to fix some long standing minor
issues and slightly improve sections not often used in classes.
Moreover, this version fixes many errata found with the help of AI
(AI was only used to identify the errors, no content was created by AI.
Also I should mention that the AI has misidentified some errors too).

<ol>
<li>To improve readability, hyphenate first-order, second-order,
constant-coefficient, etc. when used as a compound adjective.
<li>Be consistent in using plurals for ODE and PDE as ODEs and PDEs.
<li>Apparently the formula for the Gateway Arch in St. Louis is not
inscribed anywhere inside the arch (that is a myth apparently).  So just
say "per the National Park Service" as it is in NPS literature
and the website.
<li>Explicitly mention "variable-coefficient" at the end of 0.3.
<li>In Example 1.1.2, use \(t\) for the dummy variable to be
consistent with the discussion above.
<li>Be somewhat more precise in Example 1.1.6.
<li>Say a little bit more on why Example 1.2.1 is nontrivial.
<li>In Example 3.1.1, write out the equations for the
arbitrary constants.  This is the first example, it should be
as explicit as possible.
<li>Reword parts of Examples 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 to be more specific.
<li>In Example 3.1.4, add a short paragraph
to explain why \(x=u_1\) really is the solution to the original
equation.
<li>In subsection 3.1.4, reword the note about similarity to 1.6 and give
an explicit link to 1.6.
<li>Define what we mean by "square" matrix in 3.2.1.
<li>In subsection 3.2.4, mark "elementary row operations"
as a defined term and add it to the index.  Add
"row operations" to the index also for the appendix.
<li>At the end of 3.5 mention that repeated eigenvalues
have the same behavior roughly (that is, the table still applies).
<li>In Exercises 3.5.2 and 3.5.3, explicitly say that the student
should draw the vector field (it was hopefully implied in the previous
wording, but be explicit here).
<li>In 3.7.2, when first solving for the generalized eigenvalue in the
example, explicitly say that \(\vec{w}\) should solve
\({(A-3I)}^2 \vec{w} = \vec{0},\) to make the argument be clear.
<li>In the section notes for 3.8, refer to 7.1
<li>The paragraph above Theorem 3.8.2 was a little confusing about
where the commutativity comes in, so rewrite it a little.
<li>At the end of Example 3.9.3, give the general solution explicitly.
<li>In the explanation of Theorem 4.1.1 (the "proof"), include the "(t)"
in the computation of the integrals, seems clearer that way.
<li>In Example 4.2.1, give the definition of \(f(t)\) for a few of the
intervals.
<li>In subsection 4.2.3, write out the first few terms of the Fourier
series in the boxed equation for clarity, and also explicitly
say that we say "nth harmonic" for the nth term of the series.
<li>In examples 4.2.3 and 4.2.4, motivate the functions tiny bit more
than saying they appear in applications.
<li>A bit more detail in Example 4.3.1, such as explicitly noting the L.
<li>In Example 4.3.1 say that we extend (4.8) periodically and be clearer
about what we mean about just saying piecewise smooth without mentioning an
interval.
<li>In Example 4.3.6, give more detail about the second
derivative not existing by explicitly showing the first
derivative on \([-1,1]\) and plotting it in 
the figure 4.11.
<li>Just before the Example 4.5.2, the paragraph is not quite right.
There is still just one resonance frequency, we're just hitting it with
the overtones.
<li>In all of 4.6, 4.7, 4.8 more consistently label the ranges
for the \(x\) and \(t\) variables for the equation and the side conditions, in particular
give the \(t &gt; 0\) for the boundary conditions, and give the
ranges whenever introducing all the side conditions.  Also explicitly
mention the range when introducing the type of problem we are solving in
each section.
<li>Add diagram of the \((x,t)\) space for the region that we
are solving the heat equation in subsection 4.6.1.
<li>In the first paragraph of 4.6.2, also mention that the heat
equation is homogeneous as that is also needed for superposition.
<li>In the paragraph introducing superposition in 4.7, mention homogeneity
of the equation and also of the side conditions.
<li>In the hint to Exercise 4.8.5,
just get rid of \(L\) and \(\pi\) as they
just cancel anyway.
<li>In 4.9 and 4.10 in the diagrams for the region, make the region gray
and make the boundary thicker.
<li>In the exercises in 4.9, we mentioned the region by name, but in the
text we no longer use this (for decades now:) so rephrase
to remove the name.
<li><b>Change Exercise 5.2.102 to fix erratum</b>.
Change the initial shape
of the beam to be \(\sin^2(\pi x)\) to be
consistent with fixed ends.
<li>Make a clearer explanation of why resonance does not occur for
even \(n\) in the problem being solved in subsection 5.3.1.
<li>In problem 5.3.101, name the function
"triangle wave" as it's not
usually called a sawtooth.
<li>Just after 6.3.1, give both directions in formulas
for clarity.
<li>In Example 6.3.3, reverse the order of the factors
as that's the way we write the convolution integral.
<li>Give a bit more detail in 6.5.3 on a real-life application,
introduce boundedness coming from the
real-life application and use it to show \(A=0\) to fix an erratum.
<li>In Exercise 6.5.6, assume that \(y\) is bounded, although
the exercise asks for "a" solution, so this assumption is only
given to avoid reader confusion when trying to simply apply Example 6.5.3.
<li>In Exercise 6.5.7 assume that \(y\) is bounded as in the example
to fix the erratum.  Also change the hint accordingly.
<li><b>Change Exercise 6.5.104</b> to make the solution bounded and allow the
technique of the section to solve it to fix an erratum.
<li>Add Exercise 6.5.105 for the other boundary condition
for a second order equation.
<li>Add a short remark about convergence at the endpoints and that we won't
really worry about it here.
<li>Add Exercise 7.1.106 on reindexing series.
<li>After Theorem 8.4.2, mention that the expression
in the Theorem is the divergence, mention its meaning,
why its meaning makes the theorem intuitive,
and add it to the index.
<li>Mention that if a chaotic system is the weather, studying
things like attractors is like studying climate.
<li>In section A.4, make sure to use "a basis" rather than "the basis"
where appropriate.
<li>Make Example A.4.1 into an enumerate to make it easier to parse.
<li>Expand Example A.4.2 with a couple of new examples and make it into
an enumerate to make it easier to parse.
<li>In Exercise A.5.5, part a) mention that it is a basis of
\({\mathbb{R}}^3.\)
<li>Add a few more useful Laplace transforms to the table in Appendix B.
<li>In Appendix B, the transform for \(t^p\) is valid for \(p &gt; -1 .\)
<li>Many other small clarifications and improvements.
<li>Fix <a href="errata.html">errata</a>.
</ol>


<p>
<b>December 19th 2024 edition, Version 6.8 (edition 6, 8th update):</b>
<p>

The focus of this new minor revision are fixing errors,
minor clarifications and improvements to exposition,
and improvements/fixes to style and grammar.
No numbers have changed.

<ol>
<li>In Example 1.4.2, explicitly say how the volume is computed.
<li>In first example in 1.9 (1.9.1), mention explicitly that \(\alpha\) is a
constant.
<li>In section 1.9, terms in some equations were ordered with \(u_x\) first
and \(u_t\) second and some vice-versa.  Order them all the same for
consistency's sake, that is, \(u_x\) first.
This includes the exercises 1.9.1, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 1.9.6, and 1.9.101.
(There is no change in content, it's just how its presented)
<li>In section 2.2, just before Theorem 2.2.1, mention that we are for the moment
supposing that the roots are real.
<li>In exercises 2.3.9, 2.3.10, 2.3.104, 2.3.105 change "find a linear combination that works."
to "find a linear combination that gives 0." as "works" may be a little confusing or unclear.
<li>Add a few words about the quadrant in the explanation of how to get the phase shift.
It is not too important, so we don't want to dwell on it, but it turns out many students here
have not seen polar coordinates yet (or just don't remember them).  Also add the
equations for A and B in terms of C and \(\gamma\) as that makes it easier to see.
<li>In the mass-spring diagram in 2.4 and 2.6, mark the direction of the position \(x.\)
<li>At the end of 2.5, add more detail to computation with variation of
parameters.
<li>At the end of 2.5, add a paragraph recapping of how that procedure (variation of parameters)
would work in general.  Then also remark that if there is a coefficient in front of the \(y'' ,\)
it is necessary to first divide by it.
<li>Make the caption to Figure 4.17 slightly more descriptive, which as
side condition gets rid of a horrible page break.
<li>In Table 6.1, emphasize that for \(u(t-a)\) we must have \(a \geq 0 .\)
<li>Similarly, some of these restrictions on \(a\) were missing in the list
in Appendix B.
<li>After Theorem 6.1.1 (linearity of the Laplace transform), demonstrate
its use together with the table with a quick computation, rather than just
saying it.
<li>Right after the second shifting property, do a quick example
where the function is not just a constant.
<li>At the end of Example 6.2.3, emphasize that the same transfer function
can be used for any input.
<li>In Theorem 6.3.1, mention that the convolution is of exponential order.
<li>In first example in 6.5 (6.5.1), mention explicitly that \(\alpha\) is a
constant.
<li>Fix <a href="errata.html">errata</a>.
</ol>

<p>
<b>May 15th 2024 edition, Version 6.7 (edition 6, 7th update):</b>
<p>

The point of this revision is to fix errata, and also to improve wording,
clarity, and consistency in many places.  It may seem to have lots of changes but they are all
minor general polish kind of things I found while teaching.
There is essentially no new
material, except for a few short paragraphs in the Laplace transform
(periodic functions, and expanded explanation for transfer functions),
and a couple of places throughout where explanations were
expanded or added.  Most changes are in chapters 1, 2, 6, and 7, because
those were the ones I used in class.
Several exercises needed to be changed to fix errata.

<ol>
<li>After Example 0.2.1, add a short note about how the analytic solution
helped us find the parameters and how this is useful in real problems.
<li>On page 23, emphasize a bit more that if we applied the inverse function
theorem, we are integrating with respect to y.
<li>On page 33 in Example 1.3.1, explicitly separate variables before
integrating.
<li>In the Example in subsection 1.3.2, use \(D\) consistently
for the arbitrary constant.
<li>Be more precise to say that "singular solution" is the solution
that comes about because of the division by zero.
<li>In Example 1.4.2 at the very end,
explicitly say in
English that there are 11.86 kg of salt in the tank when full.
Also in the remark about concentration afterwards, write 0.1667 to approximate 1/6 to use the same
number of decimal places as the concentration.
<li>On page 58, add a displayed equations showing what the error is for
clarity.
<li>In 1.9, mention again the meaning \(u_x\) and \(u_t\) notation for
partial derivatives.
<li>Add "characteristic curve" to the index for 1.9
<li>On page 82 in the computation on top of the page add underbraces to make
it clearer what's happening.
<li>Resonance is a terrible example for a doubled root on page 86, replace
it with a reference to a critically damped mass-spring system.  Add a
remark about why two very close roots are bad (numerical instability).
<li>At the end of subsection 2.3.1, the reason why we want linear
independence was not explicitly stated so add Theorem 2.3.3 to have a
parallel with the three theorems from section 2.1.  It is mentioned in passing
in the next subsection, but this makes more sense.
<li>On page 96, explicitly say that \(t\) is in seconds and \(x\) is in
meters since we give the units of all the other variables, also we forgot to
say that current is measured in amperes.
<li>On page 105, add an explicit remark about trying a generic polynomial
even if some of the powers do not really appear on the right hand side.
<li>On pages 106 and 107, some of the particular solutions were just \(y,\)
but that's not totally consistent with the rest of the section.
<li>On page 109, the computation of the example for variation parameters,
rewrite the \(u_1'\) in a different way to make calculus easier
and use a different, somewhat simpler, antiderivative of the secant
(the one it seems the calculus books I have use).
Also be more consistent with not using parentheses after trig functions
if there is only one letter, it does seem a bit more readable this way.
<li><b>Exercise 3.8.15 part b) was changed to fix erratum</b>, the matrix given
was a typo that made the problem unnecessarily difficult and the solution in
the back was what was intended.
<li><b>Exercise 4.3.106 part f) was changed to fix erratum</b>,
we really wanted to ask about F(-9), so that we also ask for some point not in
the original range that's not the discontinuity.  The answer in the back was
in fact giving F(-9) as intended.
<li>On page 286, do not use \(F(t)\) for the forcing function as capital
\(F\) is used later in the d'Alembert solution so avoid confusion.  Also
explicitly use the words "forcing function" when we first talk about it
to make the exercises easier to figure out.
<li><b>Exercises 5.3.6 and 5.3.101 were changed to fix errata</b>:
As given, 1) the forcing functions would cause resonance and we didn't
really cover that and 2) they were given in x rather than t by mistake.
Both were changed to be on the interval \([-\pi,\pi]\) which avoids the
resonance and makes computations easier anyhow.
<li>In Theorem 6.1.2, mention the interval \([0,\infty)\) just in case
someone wonders what happened to the \(\frac{1}{t}\) counterexample.
<li>In Example 6.1.7, add an intermediate step in computing the unshifted
inverse transform.
<li>In 6.2.1, we offhand make a remark about piecewise smooth functions,
but if the functions have discontinuities, then one would have to
write a little bit more (the same procedure works, but does not get the same
formula as we'd be missing the delta functions in the derivative).
So just say "continuous" here and then the same formula will work.
<li>Replace Example 6.2.5 by a more intelligent one that is also very simple,
somewhat easier to understand, and not as trivially solved without Laplace
(still easily though).
<li>Add short note about how one can compute \(H(s)\) without knowing the
equations, just knowing \(X(s)\) for a given \(F(s) .\)
<li>Add an extremely short subsection 6.2.6 on Laplace transform of
periodic functions, which seem to pop up in these courses,
and it makes sense in the same section as where we are looking at
piecewise functions.
<li>Add Exercises 6.2.13 and 6.2.104 on transfer functions from input and
output (this is similar to the exercise on the WeBWorK).
<li>Add Exercise 6.2.14 for a periodic function.
<li>Clean up wording for exerecises 6.2.12 and 6.2.103.
<li>On page 309 add distributive law to the list of properties of
convolution.
<li>In Example 6.3.4 mention that \(\frac{1}{s^2+\omega_0^2}\) is
the transfer function (and flip the order to be consistent
with the text before).  Then after the example mention how to get the
general formula from the transfer function, thus relating transfer functions
and convolution.
<li>Use "rectangular pulse" consistently on 6.4 and put it in the index.
<li>Add a short note at the end of 6.4.1 to note that the Laplace of the
given pulse function goes to 1.
<li>On page 314, when writing the convolution with delta, be more consistent.
<li>On page 316, after Example 6.4.2, write convolutions all in the same order for consistency,
use \(h\) for the impulse response for consistency and to
not jump back and forth with \(x\) and \(y ,\)
in general make the wording clearer about how the computation works in
general, and finally mention
that the impulse response is just the
inverse Laplace transform of the transfer function.
<li>On page 330, when writing out the Taylor series, mention that it
is a power series to drive that point home and also
expand a few terms as it is sometimes not totally clear what the \(k=0\) term
means here.
<li>Expand the first few terms of the differentiated series on page 331
to make it clearer what it looks like.
<li>In sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, add 0.5 lecture to the estimates in the
note for instructors, they were too optimistic.
I just did them each in 2 lectures and I felt it was about the same pace as
chapters 1 and 2 where I was hitting my estimates spot on.
<li>In sections 7.2 and 7.3, name the coefficients
\(P(x),\) \(Q(x),\) \(R(x)\) since lower case letters are used for
other things, most confusingly little \(r.\)
<li>In 7.3, say a little bit more explicitly in the beginning that we're
just trying to find a solution on one side of the singular point.  Also
mention the thing about what the singular point does to the initial value
in the first example.
<li>In 7.3 when describing the method, mention very quickly what to do
if \(x_0\) is not zero.
<li><b>Exercise 8.4.101 part c was changed to fix erratum</b>:
The system is changed to \(x'=xy^2,y'=x+x^2 ,\) and then the solution
in the back (changing \(y\) to \(y^2\) of course) works.
<li>Fix <a href="errata.html">errata</a>.
</ol>


<p>
<b>October 26th 2023 edition, Version 6.6 (edition 6, 6th update):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li><b>Change Exercise 3.1.106</b> to fix an erratum.  Rate of flow from tank 2 back into tank 1 should
be \(r-s ,\) otherwise volumes do not stay constant and the problem doesn't quite all make sense.
<li>Add a couple of minor clarifications to the end of Example 1.9.3.
<li>Slightly tighter spacing in 3.1 leads to a slight change (for the better I
think) in pagination in the section.
<li>In the HTML version, add light horizontal rules to visually
separate out figures and tables.
<li>A few minor clarifications and improvements in English and style.
<li>Fix <a href="errata.html">errata</a>.
</ol>

<p>
<b>July 18th 2023 edition, Version 6.5 (edition 6, 5th update):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>In 0.3, add the nonlinear pendulum equation as an example nonlinear equation.
<li>Also in 0.3, say a bit about difficulty of nonlinear equations, to give some
  motivation for why we study linear equations
<li>Also in 0.3, give the general form for an autonomous first order ode to
  drive the point home.
<li>Move Example 1.1.1 up by a paragraph as it makes more sense that way.
<li>In Example 1.4.2, explain where the \(2t\) comes up for figuring out when
  the tank is full, and emphasize that the concentration is when we divide
  by the volume, by the 100.
<li>In Example 1.5.2, note what \(F(v)\) is for clarity.
<li>Also in Example 1.5.2, note just before that since we have to avoid \(x=0\)
  we might as well assume \(x &gt; 0\) or \(x &lt; 0 . \)  Use \(x &gt; 0\) in the
  example for simplicity and therefore get rid of most of the absolute
  value signs.
<li>In 1.6, add a short note about plotting \(y=f(x)\) to figure out the
  signs.
<li>In 1.7, tighten the language when describing first vs. second order
  method, leading to slightly nicer page breaks as a side benefit.
<li>In Example 1.8.7, in the final solution for \(F(x,y)\) we better put
  absolute values around \(y .\)  In a sense it is not wrong
  but we would require the complex logarithm otherwise. 
<li>When talking about "linear operator" after Theorem 2.1.1,
  mention that it seems almost as if we are multiplying by it.
<li>In Exercise 2.1.6, explicitly mention the name of the equation and
  say "see above" as the explanatory note is on the previous page.
<li>A few minor clarifications.
<li>Several improvements in wording and fixes for grammar and style.
<li>Fix <a href="errata.html">errata</a>.
</ol>


<p>
<b>November 20th 2022 edition, Version 6.4 (edition 6, 4th update):</b>
<p>


<ol>
<li>Reformulate end of Example 1.8.5 so that it's clear that at the end we
are talking about the corresponding \(M \, dx + N \, dy = 0\) equation.
Also note that \(x=-1\) itself is a solution to that.
<li><b>Change Exercise 6.4.5 to fix erratum</b>, in particular,
the impulse response given is changed to \(t e^{-t} . \)
<li><b>Change Exercise 6.4.103 to fix erratum</b>, in particular,
the impulse response given is changed to \(e^t \sin(t) \) and the
equation whose solution is sought is changed to \(Lx = e^t .\)
<li>Add Remark 6.4.2 after Example 6.4.2, which explains what's going on
with the \(x'(0)=0\) by noting that \(x'\) has a jump at \(t=0\) to produce
the delta function.
<li>Add footnote when defining the integral of the delta function that we
are always taking the endpoints.
<li>Make discussion of the radius of convergence based on the ratio test a bit more
readable.
<li>In 8.5 when talking about the Lorentz system attractor, be clearer by
explicitly saying that the solution tends to the attractor.
<li>Due to changes in LaTeX (namely the newpx fonts), pagination has changed
very slightly.  In the new version the theoremfont option seems to be buggy
so go back to regular punctuation in theorems and exercises, one can't even
tell.
<li>In the HTML version, tables are now numbered properly.
<li>Other minor improvements in wording and style.
<li>Fix <a href="errata.html">errata</a>.
</ol>

<p>
<b>May 6th 2022 edition, Version 6.3 (edition 6, 3rd update):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li><b>Change initial condition in Exercise 1.1.103 to fix an erratum.</b>
The previous initial condition meant looking at a point where the
differential equation is undefined.  While one can solve the problem
continuously, and the formal process just works, it's best to avoid it.
The initial condition is changed to \(x(0)=\frac{\pi}{4}\) where the equation
is well behaved.
<li>In the process of fixing an erratum from Martin Irungu (a sign error in the
"proof" of Theorem 6.1.2; the final answer is off by a sign),  implement
Martin's suggestion to write the whole thing in terms of the positive \(s-c\)
rather than the negative \(c-s,\) which clearly leads to more typos.
<li>For some reason a new version of LaTeX is now making some spacing slightly
different (being a little bit more generous with space under figures for
example), so the pagination is slightly different in places.  I went through
and tried to get rid of bad page breaks by tightening up the language where
needed (a good thing to do anyhow), so it is only in a couple of places where
page breaks changed.
<li>Some minor wording improvements.
<li>Fix <a href="errata.html">errata</a>.
</ol>


<p>
<b>June 9th 2021 edition, Version 6.2 (edition 6, 2nd update):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>Add exercises 2.5.11, 2.5.106.
<li>Emphasize the main idea of subsection 6.4.3 to make it easier to pick out.
<li>Minor wording improvements throughout.
<li>Add a couple of sentences on how the arrows in vector fields are scaled
in 3.1.4.
<li>Add a few explicit cross references instead of vague "in a previous
example" and similar.
<li>Fix the <a href="errata.html">errata</a>.
</ol>

<p>
<b>July 21st 2020 edition, Version 6.1 (edition 6, 1st update):</b>
<p>

Very minor update.

<ol>
<li>Some minor improvements in language and style, and minor typo fixes.
<li>A few very minor clarifications.
<li>Mainly, fix the <a href="errata.html">errata</a>.
</ol>

<p>
<b>November 7th 2019 edition, Version 6.0 (edition 6, 0th update):</b>
<p>

This is a major update.  The main addition is a new appendix on linear
algebra, so that a combined diffyqs/linear algebra course can be run with the
book.  There is also a new optional section on linear first order PDEs, and
another on solving PDEs with Laplace transforms.  A bunch of new exercises were
added, some figures, and exposition was improved throughout.

<p>
Numbering is as
consistent as possible.  <b>Exercises, chapters, sections were <i>not</i> renumbered</b> (as
always).  Figures, numbered examples, some subsections, and equations might have changed numbers due to the edits
(see below).
The name of first and fifth chapter was updated (but not the number). So
the book is therefore a drop in replacement, and existing courses should not need to be updated
(unless giving page ranges, or referring to Figures or numbered examples).

<p>
Here is a complete list of changes:


<ol>
<li>Add appendix A on linear algebra.
<li>Add section 1.9 on first order linear PDE and characteristics.
<li>Add section 6.5 on solving PDE with Laplace transform.
<li>Add appendix B with a more complete list of Laplace transforms.

<li>Renumberings:
  <ul>
  <li>Figures in chapters 1, 3, 4, and 8
  <li>Examples in 2.2, 3.1, 4.6, 7.1 (past the root test), 8.4
  <li>Subsections in 2.2
  <li>Equations in chapter 4
  </ul>

<li>Change name of first chapter to "First order equations" since we are
  adding a PDE section.

<li>Many clarifications as to arguments of sin/cos/sinh/cosh, that is, use more parentheses.  In fact,
any argument that is not a single symbol is now parenthesized, and some even if they are single symbol.
It is not as pretty, but it's a lot more readable.
<li>On bottom of page 173, there was the constant term of 1/4 missing in the
Fourier series for the solution x.
<li>On page 237, Heaviside function definition was off it should be 1 for all t &ge; 0.
<li>On page 239 near middle of page, there was an
\(e^{-2s}\)
that should be
\(e^{-3s}\)
though the inverse transform was then done correctly.  Thanks to Sean Raleigh and Jessica Robinson for
spotting this one.
<li>On page 240, when applying the Laplace transform to solve an integral equation, there
was a missing equals sign and x(t) was mistakenly called f(t)
<li>On page 241, exercises 6.2.3, 6.2.4, and 6.2.5 were trivial as given (x=0
is the solution).  What I means was to make the initial conditions arbitrary,
i.e. \(x(0)=a\) and \(x'(0)=b.\)  Thanks to Sean Raleigh and Jessica Robinson for
spotting this one.
<li>On page 242, exercise 6.3.2, change all \(\omega_0\) to \(\omega.\)
Thanks to Sean Raleigh and Jessica Robinson for
spotting this one.
<li>Add exercise 6.2.8.
<li>Mark example 6.2.4 as an example.
<li>Minor other clarifications and cosmetic improvements in places.
<li>Fixed many minor typos and mistakes.

<i>Pagination and numbering is kept as constant as possible.  The following
changes were made:</i>

<ol>
<li>Exercise 4.1.4 on page 145 had forgotten applications of chain rule in computations.  The final result is not changed.  Thanks to Michael Angelini for pointing this out.
<li>The eigenfunctions are cos kt (not sin kt) on top of page 146.
<li>Clarify and add more information to exercise 2.6.5.
<li>Page 153 was a little confusing, consistently use 1 as the constant
eigenfunction and frame the formula for \(a_0\) at the bottom of the
page.
<li>Also on page 153, define the inner product without scaling by 
\(\frac{1}{\pi}\) for consistency.
<li>Clarify the definition at endpoints for periodic functions.
<li>On page 157-158 stay with the square wave example to talk about the
values at discontinuities to avoid jumping around.
<li>On page 163 top, the condition about existence of one sided limits at
all the endpoints is now correct.
<li>Be less cavalier with equality in the Fourier series section.  Remove
a couple of unnecessary "f(t)=" before a series, before we have talked
about convergence.
<li>Clarify exercises 4.3.6 and 4.3.7
<li>Add exercises 4.3.8, 4.3.9, and 6.1.12
<li>On page 168 of course it is the cosine terms disappear for an odd
extension, not the sine terms.
<li>On page 170 on the top, there was a plus sign missing in the series
after
\(\frac{a_0}{2}.\)
<li>On page 212 we mistakenly said that eigenvalues are lambdas with no nontrivial solutions (thanks to Sean Raleigh).
<li>On page 217, the integral that is the inner product of the sine with itself should not have f(t) in it, the one that equals
\(\frac{\pi}{4}\)
(thanks again to Sean Raleigh).
<li>On page 222, Newton's second came out all jumbled up.  Of course it is "force equals mass times acceleration"
(and again: Sean Raleigh).
<li>Add hint to exercise 5.1.1 as there is a subtle issue.
<li>Minor other clarifications and cosmetic improvements in places.
<li>Fixed many minor typos and mistakes.

<i>Pagination and numbering is kept as constant as possible.  The following
changes were made:</i>

<ol>
<li>Exercise 2.4.5 was not possible.  Replace 0.8 with 1.1 and 0.39 with 0.8.
Also add a note that you always get two possibilities for the mass
in the formulas.
<li>Fix the formula for the complex roots on page 54, that is the discriminant should be negated under the square root sign if we take out an <i>i</i>.
<li>Fix theorem 4.1.2.   There was an unneeded hypothesis about p and q which do not appear in the theorem.
<li>On page 60, fix the solution corresponding to complex roots.
<li>On page 60, fix the factorization of the characteristic equation in
example 2.3.5.
<li>Also on page 60, relabel the arbitrary constants to be more consistent
and make them all upper case.
<li>IODE Project III has changed (there was always some confusion about what was Project III)
and now fits more after section 2.3, rather than before 2.6.
<li>On page 75 on top, there was a typo in the expression for \(u_1',\) the x should be an argument to the cosine.
<li>In example 2.6.1, when stating the parameters, it should say m=0.5
(the example was computed correctly, so no other changes).
<li>Add exercise 2.4.6.
<li>Add hint to exercise 2.4.1.
<li>Theorem 2.5.1 holds for any order, so simply drop the words "second order"
<li>In exercise 2.5.1, also explicitly state that the initial conditions must
be satisfied.
<li>Remove unneeded reference to [EP] on page 73.
<li>Put a box around the formula for the practical resonance frequency on page
81.
<li>Minor clarifications in places.
<li>Add a few more words to the index.
<li>Fixed other minor typos and mistakes.

<li>Fix the computation of the constants in Example 2.4.1.  Also fix the
discussion right after the example, and fix Figure 2.2.
<li>Fix examples on page 72 and 73.
<li>Fix example 6.1.7 (page 234), the inverse transform was off by an extra 1/2.
<li>Fix example 6.3.3 (page 243), the convolution was not computed correctly.
<li>Figure on page 37 (bottom of page) should have x=5 and x=0.  Thanks to Jeff Winegar for pointing it out.
<li>Add Theorem 2.1.3 to highlight the fact that the superposition of two linearly independent solutions is the general solution to the homogeneous equation.
<li>Add Theorem 2.5.1, to give the solution to highlight how nonhomogeneous
equations are solved.
<li>Add k to the examples on top of page 49 to make them less trivial.
<li>Exercise 2.3.4 was hard to read correctly, reformulate.
<li>Due to minor changes in the text, Figure 4.12 moved up a page resulting in
a much more logical pagination.
<li>Many small clarifications.

<i>Pagination and numbering is kept as constant as possible.  The following
changes were made:</i>

<ol>
<li> Fix error in example on page 34.  The integrating factor is off by
a constant.  Instead rework the example to be done by substituting into
formula (1.4).  Thanks to Sean Raleigh for noticing.
<li> Integrate in a different way in Example 1.1.3 to get rid of an extra k.
Also fix up the constant in front.  Finally rename C' to D and add assumption
that k &gt; 0.
<li> Fix the derivation in example 1.3.3, there was a negative sign mistake in
the middle, though it made no difference in the solution.  Also consistently
keep time in minutes for the example.
<li> Fix example 1.4.1, there was a missing minus sign in the solution.  Thanks
to Ian Simon for pointing it out.
<li> Fix example on page 103.  The expression for \(x_1\) in the middle of
the page should have \(e^t\cos(t) -i e^t\sin(t).\)  The rest of
the example also needed to have the signs fixed.  Thanks to Sean Raleigh
for noticing.
<li> Exercise 1.1.7 had a typo making the solution very hard (without a computer
algebra system).  The right hand side should be a
\(\frac{1}{y+1}\)
not
\(\frac{1}{y^2+1}.\)
<li> Exercise 1.3.7 was impossible (typo in the equation) replace with a
different exercise.
<li> Add forgotten initial condition to Exercise 0.2.9 (\(x'(0)=0\)).
<li> Exercise 1.5.6 was way too difficult.  Replace with an easier exercise.
<li> Add "then find x(10)" to exercise 1.1.1.
<li> Fix caption on Figure 1.
<li> Fix captions on Figure 1.7-1.10 (replace -0.1 by 0.1), replace Figures
1.6-1.10 with new versions which have the correct vertical scale.
<li> In example 1.2.2, use
\(\operatorname{sgn}(x)x^2\)
for an example solution.
<li> Add exercises 0.2.11, 1.1.9-10, 1.2.5, 1.3.8-12, 1.4.11-12, 1.7.5
<li> Exercise 1.5.1 was already worked out as an example.  Replace.
<li> Regenerate some of the figures for better looking output using better
parameters and newer version of genius.
<li> Clarify exposition somewhat in many places, and clarify some exercises.
<li> Fix some other minor grammar mistakes or simply awkward English in places.
