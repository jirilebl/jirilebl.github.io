A first course on differential equations, aimed at engineering
students.  The prerequisite for the course is the basic calculus sequence.
This free online book (OER more formally)
should be usable as a stand-alone
textbook or as a companion to a course using another book such as
Edwards and Penney,
<em>Dif&shy;fe&shy;ren&shy;tial Equa&shy;tions and Boun&shy;da&shy;ry Va&shy;lue Pro&shy;blems:
Computing and Modeling</em>
or Boyce and DiPrima,
<em>El&shy;e&shy;men&shy;tary Dif&shy;fer&shy;en&shy;tial Equa&shy;tions and Boun&shy;da&shy;ry Va&shy;lue Pro&shy;blems</em>
(section correspondence to these two is given).
I developed and used this book to teach Math
286/285 at the Uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty of Illi&shy;nois at Ur&shy;ba&shy;na-Cham&shy;paign
(one is a
4-day-a-week, the other a 3-day-a-week semester-long course).
I also used it for
Math 20D at the Uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty of Ca&shy;li&shy;for&shy;nia, San Diego
(a 3-day-a-week quarter-long course)
and Math 2233 (semester-long introduction) and Math 4233 (an upper division
continuation of 2233) at
Okla&shy;homa State Uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty.
There is enough material to run
a two-semester sequence depending on lecturer speed.
<p>
The aim is to provide a low cost, redistributable, not overly long,
high-quality textbook that students will keep rather than selling back
after the semester is over.
Even if the students throw it out or sell it, they can always
look it up on the net again.
Or perhaps today's students mostly use online sources to begin with.
(Chan&shy;ces are your students might be using this book even if you are
requiring another one.)
You are free to have a local bookstore or copy
store make and sell copies for your students.
See below about the license.
<p>
Another aim of the book is to allow modification and customization
for a specific purpose if necessary.  If you do modify the book,
mark it prominently as such to avoid confusion.  This aspect is important for
the longevity of the book as well.
The book can be updated, fixed, and modified even if I happen
to drop off the face of the earth.
You do not have to depend on any publisher
being interested as with traditional textbooks.
<p>
Finally, errata are fixed promptly.
No need to wait several years for a new edition.
Every once in a while I may make some major addition and a new major version
(edition), and then in between as errata are fixed I make minor version
updates (like a corrected printing) usually once or twice a year, 
depending on the errata discovered.  Exercise, chapter, and section numbers
are preserved as much as humanly possible.
What's added is added at the end with new numbers, so the book is generally
compatible even if students (or the instructor) have an older printed copy.
The minor updates are totally interchangeable and have very minimal
changes, essentially nothing new.
<p>
<!--
While the textbook may be used by itself, it can also be used in conjunction
with the <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/iode-diffeq/">IODE</a> software.  IODE is a
free software package for experimenting with basic ODEs developed at University
of Illinois specifically for teaching this course.  IODE works both with <a
href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a> (proprietary) and <a
href="http://www.octave.org">Octave</a> (free).  The IODE website has several
extra projects for the students to work through as homework. -->
The graphs in the
book were created using the <a href="https://www.jirka.org/genius.html">Genius</a> software.

<p>
MAA published a 
<a href="http://www.maa.org/publications/maa-reviews/notes-on-diffy-qs-differential-equations-for-engineers">review of the book</a>
(they looked at the De&shy;cem&shy;ber 2012 edition;
quite bit of stuff has happened since then).

There are 747 exercises throughout the book, <!-- (August 6th, 2025 edition),-->
251 of which have a solution in the back
(those numbered 101 and above).
A few exercises are within the section text, but most are in their
own subsection at the end of every section.  Each section should have enough exercises
for homework even for a demanding class.
<!--  The <a
href="https://publish.illinois.edu/iode-diffeq/">IODE</a> projects offer alternatives
to homework and also include independent extra exercises.-->

<p>
I get a bit of money when you buy these (depending on where exactly they are
bought).  Probably enough to buy
me a coffee, so by buying a copy you will support this project.  You will also
save your toner cartridge.
The difference between these two versions is
essentially just the cover art.  I have seen printed versions from both and
they are both good quality.

<a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">Sage</a> is a very comprehensive
free mathematical software.
Here we collect some relevant Sage worksheets and demonstrations you can play around with.
Some simply use Sage to give a demonstration,
but many are worksheets where you can edit the code and use it to experiment.
The code here runs on the free SageCell server; you cannot save your work and there are
other limitations.  If you want to use Sage without installing
but still want to be able to save your work and do more complicated
computations, consider <a href="https://cocalc.com">CoCalc</a>, which is a
cloud based Sage installation.

improved since I recorded the lectures, so they might not match 100%.

<h3 style="clear:left">Online homework (WeBWorK / Edfinity):</h3>

<p>
<b><a href="https://openwebwork.org/">WeBWorK</a>:</b>
I put together a set of problems for WeBWorK with 497 problems.
<a href="diffyqs-webwork.tgz">Download the set</a>
as a tgz file
(or <a href="https://github.com/jirilebl/diffyqs-webwork/">see the github repository</a>).
Just upload the tgz file to your WeBWorK course,
and it will automatically unpack in your templates directory
and create a directory called <span class=tt>diffyqs-webwork</span>.
There are predefined problem sets for the relevant sections,
as "def" files, that you can "import" as new homework.
There are currently problems for chapters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, A.
The problems also have links to the web version of the book for easy reference.
Majority of the problems come from OPL (Open Problem Library), but have been
edited to fit the course or generally improved, some have been edited or
changed quite heavily, and quite a few new problems were added.
There should be enough
problems for most types of courses, but let me know if anything is missing, or
if there are other OPL problems that you think I should include.
<!--Currently I'd say the set is <i>beta</i> quality.-->

<p>
<b><a href="https://www.edfinity.com">Edfinity</a>:</b>
Essentially the same set of problems, based on a slightly older version of my set, is
<!--A slightly older version of the problem set is-->
<a href="https://www.edfinity.com/products/5c8199d3b8497d000d4e5eb1">available on Edfinity</a>.
Edfinity may be a bit easier to use than WeBWorK, you don't have to install
anything, it is hosted by Edfinity, and is student-paid.
Unfortunately, the Edfinity set seems to have diverged from my version over time,
and for example, these do not have the book links.
You can still add other OPL problems into your class,
create your own, or if you prefer my set, you can download the set above and
paste in my set as webwork problems.

<p>
Let me know (<script>
var username = "jiri" + "." + "lebl";
var hostname = "g" + "mail" + ".com";
var linktext = username + "@" + hostname;
document.write("<a href='" + "mail" + "to:" + linktext + "'>" + linktext + "</a>");
</script>) if you use the problem set.  I'm also interested to know any
feedback on what's missing, what should be changed, etc.

<h3 style="clear:left">Discussion/Announcement forum:</h3>

<p>
I set up a discussion forum for the book on
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/notes-on-diffy-qs-forum">Google
Groups</a>.  I expect this to be a low volume forum, but it might be a good
place for instructors to interact, where to post extra material, ask a question
of the other instructors, discuss the WeBWorK problems, and I will send
announcements there, such as when a new version is out.

<h3 style="clear:left">Other instructor resources:</h3>

<p>
I put together all the <a href="diffyqs-figures.zip">figures as PDFs</a>
as one big zipfile.  This should make it easier to create computer slides using
the figures, without messing with the source tarball.  If a figure
appears in multiple places, its filename only refers to the first such place.

<p>
There's tons of extra materials (including longer modeling projects) at
<a href="https://simiode.qubeshub.org/">SIMIODE</a>.

<p>
The <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/iode-diffeq/">IODE</a> software is a
free software package for experimenting with basic ODEs developed at University
of Illinois specifically for teaching this kind of course.
IODE works both with <a
href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a> (proprietary) and <a
href="http://www.octave.org">Octave</a> (free, but no GUI).
The IODE website has several
extra projects for the students to work through as homework.

<p>
Adam Spiegler of the University of Colorado Denver has put together
<a href="https://aspiegler.github.io/Exploring-Differential-Equations/">a
suite of Jupyter notebooks</a> that are linked to various sections in
this book and also in Trench's book.

<h2 style="clear:left">Translations, derivative versions, video lectures:</h2>

<p>
Prof. <a href="http://mtm.ufsc.br/~martin/">Martin Weilandt</a> of Universidade
de Santa Catarina has prepared a partial Portuguese translation.  See <a
href="http://mtm.ufsc.br/~martin/2011-2-calc-c/index.html">his class page</a>.

<p>
Prof. Charles Bergeron has created a modified version of the book.  The title is
<a href="http://www.differentialequations.net">Differential Equations:
Including Linear Algebra Topics And Computer-Aided Problem-Solving</a>.  This
book removes some topics (e.g. PDEs), and adds its own linear algebra
chapter (this was before appendix A).
The book covers the use of the computer algebra system Maxima in
the context of the material.

<p>
The department at University at Buffalo (Brian Hassard, James Javor, John
Ringland, Asela Viraj) have created their own edition without the PDE content
and including some extra content on using python.

<p>
Prof. Matthew Charnley made a <a
href="https://sites.rutgers.edu/matthew-charnley/course-materials/differential-equations-an-introduction-for-engineers/">version</a>
for Rutgers University that modifies and restructures the text to fit the syllabus at
Rutgers and, for example, adds an appendix on using MATLAB.

<p>
The text (slightly older version) has been entered into the <a href="https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Differential_Equations/Book%3A_Differential_Equations_for_Engineers_(Lebl)">libretext.org platform</a>
run by UC Davis.

<p>
Trefor Bazett of the University of Victoria, has a <a href="https://web.uvic.ca/~tbazett/diffyqs/">custom version</a> including video lectures on YouTube (linked from
his version of the text).

<p>
Allan Majdanec of Douglass College created a set of <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2cnMVuUCPtkjT7OJj6273MUDJeoBmIx9">video lectures on YouTube</a>
using the book (though slightly different order of sections).


<h2 style="clear:left">Source:</h2>
<p>
The source is hosted on <b>GitHub</b>:
<a href="https://github.com/jirilebl/diffyqs">https://github.com/jirilebl/diffyqs</a>
<p>
You can get an archive of the source of the released version on github, look under
<a href="https://github.com/jirilebl/diffyqs/releases">https://github.com/jirilebl/diffyqs/releases</a>,
though if you plan to work with it, maybe best to look at just the latest working version
as that might have any errata or new additions.  Though these might be a work in progress.
Perhaps best is to let me know.
<p>
The main file is
<span class=tt>diffyqs.tex</span>, which includes the chapters that are in separate
files <span class=tt>ch-*.tex</span>.  I compile the pdf with <span class=tt>pdflatex diffyqs</span>.  You also want
to run <span class=tt>makeindex</span> to generate the index (I generally run <span class=tt>pdflatex
diffyqs</span> three times, then <span class=tt>makeindex diffyqs</span>, and then finally
<span class=tt>pdflatex diffyqs</span> again).  The setup file with all the preamble you may
want to edit is <span class=tt>diffyqssetup.sty</span>.
<p>
The github 'master' version is the current working version,
so it will have whatever new changes I make in my tree.
<p>
Slides (incomplete so far) used for the youtube lectures:
<a href="deslides.zip">as PDFs</a> (may have been edited since recording).
The LaTeX source for the slides is available on github
in the <span class=tt>slides</span> subdirectory.
You have to build them from there to get the figures right if you want to
rework the slides, or you'd have to probably modify the source and copy the
figures out of the <span class=tt>figures</span> subdirectory.
Feel free to use them for your class, the license is the same as the book.
