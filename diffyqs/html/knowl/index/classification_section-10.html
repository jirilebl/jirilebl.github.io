<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">All the equations and systems given as examples above are linear. Linearity may not be immediately obvious for Maxwell’s equations unless you write out the divergence and curl in terms of partial derivatives. If an equation is not linear, we say it is <em class="emphasis">nonlinear</em>. Let us see some example nonlinear equations.  Burger’s equation,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} + 
y \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} =
\nu \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} ,
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">is a nonlinear second-order partial differential equation.  It is nonlinear because <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\)</span> are multiplied together. The equation</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2\tag{4}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">is a nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equation as there is a second power of the dependent variable <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>  Another nonlinear ODE is the pendulum equation</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
\theta''+\sin(\theta)=0 ,\tag{5}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">which is nonlinear as the dependent variable <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> appears inside a <span class="process-math">\(\sin\)</span> function. Nonlinear equations are notoriously difficult to solve and their solutions may behave in strange and unexpected ways. Perhaps you have heard of chaos theory and butterflies in the Amazon causing hurricanes in the Atlantic, all due to nonlinear equations. So sometimes we study related linear equations, such as <span class="process-math">\(\theta''+\theta=0\)</span> for the pendulum, instead. The solutions to <span class="process-math">\(\theta''+\sin(\theta) = 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\theta''+\theta=0\)</span> are different, but they are close for some short time, and the linear equation is far simpler to solve and analyze.</div>
