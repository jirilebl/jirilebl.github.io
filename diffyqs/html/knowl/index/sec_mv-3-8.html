<div class="para">Here is an example for electrical engineers.  Consider the pictured RLC circuit. There is a resistor with a resistance of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> ohms, an inductor with an inductance of <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> henries, and a capacitor with a capacitance of <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> farads.  There is also an electric source (such as a battery) with voltage of <span class="process-math">\(E(t)\)</span> volts at time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> (measured in seconds). Let <span class="process-math">\(Q(t)\)</span> be the charge (in coulombs) on the capacitor and <span class="process-math">\(I(t)\)</span> be the current (in amperes) in the circuit.  The relation between the two is <span class="process-math">\(Q' = I\text{.}\)</span>  By elementary principles, we find <span class="process-math">\(L I' + RI + \nicefrac{Q}{C} = E\text{.}\)</span>   We differentiate to get</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
L I''(t) + R I'(t) + \frac{1}{C} I(t) = E'(t) .
\end{equation}

<div class="para">This is a nonhomogeneous second-order constant-coefficient linear equation. As <span class="process-math">\(L, R\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> are all positive, this circuit behaves just like the mass and spring system.  Position of the mass is replaced by current. Mass is replaced by inductance, damping is replaced by resistance, and the spring constant is replaced by one over the capacitance.  The change in voltage becomes the forcing function—for constant voltage this is an unforced motion.</div>
