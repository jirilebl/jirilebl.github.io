<div class="para">In terms of multivariable calculus, at each point <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> in the plane, <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v} = (M,N)\)</span> is a vector, that is, a direction and a magnitude. As <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> are functions of <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\text{,}\)</span> we have a <em class="emphasis">vector field</em>. A vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}\)</span> that comes from an exact equation is a so-called <em class="emphasis">conservative vector field</em>, that is, a vector field that comes with a potential function <span class="process-math">\(F(x,y)\text{,}\)</span> such that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
\vec{v} = \left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} ,\frac{\partial F}{\partial
y} \right) .
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> be a path in the plane starting at <span class="process-math">\((x_1,y_1)\)</span> and ending at <span class="process-math">\((x_2,y_2)\text{.}\)</span> If we think of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}\)</span> as force, then the work required to move along <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> is the path integral</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
\int_\gamma \vec{v}(\vec{r}) \cdot d\vec{r}
=
\int_\gamma M \, dx + N \, dy
=
F(x_2,y_2) - F(x_1,y_1) .
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">In other words, the work done depends only on the endpoints—where we start and where we end. For example, suppose <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is gravitational potential (physicists use the convention that <span class="process-math">\(-F\)</span> is the potential, but idea is the same). The derivative of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> given by <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}\)</span> is the gravitational force. What we are saying is that the work required to move a heavy box from the ground floor to the roof only depends on the change in potential energy. The work done is the same no matter what path we took; if we took the stairs or the elevator. Although if we took the elevator, the elevator did the work for us. Movement along the curves <span class="process-math">\(F(x,y) = C\)</span> requires no work done, such as the heavy box sliding along without accelerating or braking on a perfectly flat roof on a cart with incredibly well-oiled wheels.</div>
