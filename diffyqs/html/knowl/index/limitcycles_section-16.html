<div class="para">The theorem gives a way of ruling out the existence of a closed trajectory, and hence a way of ruling out limit cycles. The expression <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\)</span> may seem random, but it is called the <em class="emphasis">divergence</em> of the vector field. Divergence measures how much the vector field is “expanding” at any point and comes up in many other contexts. The theorem says that if the vector field is either expanding everywhere on <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> or contracting everywhere on <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> then there is no closed trajectory and so no limit cycle. Perhaps this is intuitive—if particles travel along the vector fields and are getting further and further apart, then we do not expect any particles to travel in loops. The exception about points or curves means that divergence can be zero at a few points, or on a curve, but not on any larger set.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#limitcycles_section-16" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
