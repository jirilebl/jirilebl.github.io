<div class="para">We can think of a periodic function as a “signal” that is a superposition of many signals of pure frequency. For example, we could think of the square wave as a tone of certain base frequency coming through the speaker of your computer. This base frequency is called the <em class="emphasis">fundamental frequency</em> and that is the “musical note” that you identify this sound as. But the square wave will also be a superposition of many different pure tones of frequencies that are multiples of the fundamental frequency. In music, the higher frequencies are called the <em class="emphasis">overtones</em>. All the frequencies that appear are called the <em class="emphasis">spectrum</em> of the signal. On the other hand, if the signal were a simple sine wave instead of the square wave, then it is only the pure tone of fundamental frequency (no overtones). The simplest way to make sound using a computer is the square wave, and the sound is very different from a pure tone. If you ever played video games from the 1980s or so, then you heard what square waves sound like.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#ts_section-5-13" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
