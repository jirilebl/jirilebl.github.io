<div class="para">First, we consider salt and brine tanks, but this time water flows from one to the other and back. Imagine we have two tanks, each containing volume <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> liters of salt brine. The amount of salt in the first tank is <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> grams, and the amount of salt in the second tank is <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> grams. Let <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> denote time—the independent variable. The liquid in each tank is being constantly and perfectly mixed and flows or is pumped at a rate of <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> liters per second out of each tank into the other.

<div class="para">Similarly, to find the rate <span class="process-math">\(x_2'\text{,}\)</span> the roles of <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> are reversed.  All in all, the system of ODEs for this problem is</div>

<div class="para">In this system, we cannot solve for <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> separately.

</div> <div class="para">We do not yet know how to find all the solutions, but intuitively we can at least find some solutions.  Suppose we know that initially the tanks have the same amount of salt.  That is, we have an initial condition such as <span class="process-math">\(x_1(0)=x_2(0) = C\text{.}\)</span>  Then clearly the amount of salt entering and leaving each tank is the same, so the amounts are not changing.  In other words, <span class="process-math">\(x_1 = C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2 = C\)</span> (the constant functions) is a solution:  <span class="process-math">\(x_1' = x_2' = 0\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{r}{V}(x_2-x_1) = \frac{r}{V}(x_1-x_2) = 0\text{,}\)</span> so the equations are satisfied.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#sintro_closedbrine-example-1-6" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
</div> <div class="para">Let us think about the setup a little bit more without solving it.  Suppose the initial conditions are <span class="process-math">\(x_1(0) = A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2(0) = B\text{,}\)</span> for two different constants <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span>  Since no salt is coming in or out of this closed system, the total amount of salt is constant.  That is, <span class="process-math">\(x_1+x_2\)</span> is constant, and so it equals <span class="process-math">\(A+B\text{.}\)</span> Intuitively, if <span class="process-math">\(A &gt; B\text{,}\)</span> more salt will flow out of tank one than into it.  After a long time, we then expect the amount of salt in each tank to equalize. In other words, the solutions of both <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> should tend towards <span class="process-math">\(\frac{A+B}{2}\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> goes to <span class="process-math">\(\infty\text{.}\)</span> Once you know how to solve systems, you can check that this really is so.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#sintro_closedbrine-example-1-7" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
