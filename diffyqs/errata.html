<h1>Notes on Diffy Qs: Differential Equations for Engineers: Errata</h1>

<p>
Every book (no matter how much you paid for it) has errors and typos, especially
text that is new in a given edition.
I try to be as transparent as possible about any errors found, and I try to fix them
as quickly as possible.  Please do let me know if you find any errors or typos, so that
they may be fixed.  A free book relies on readers sending in corrections.

<p>
This page lists actual math errors in the various editions.  Simple typos,
misspellings, and such are not listed here.
Also not listed are things that were correct but simply deserved improvement.
Of course, older editions
suffer from recently discovered errata as well.

<p>
<b>December 11th 2025 edition (version 6.10):</b>
<p>

No known errata.

<p>
<b>August 6th 2025 edition (version 6.9):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>In Exercise 0.3.3, the condition that \(a \not= 0\) is missing.
<li>In Exercise 1.7.2, the assumption that the actual solution is greater than the approximate ones is missing.
Someone told me about this a long time ago, but I have forgotten about it, and now I don't remember who I should thank,
but, thanks!
<li>In the discussion after Theorem 2.1.3 (page 81),
it should say that \(y_1 = \cos x\)
and \(y_2 = \sin x\) (the sine and cosine were swapped).
<li>In 2.4 (page 97), when describing the pendulum, it says \(g\) is the force of gravity.  That's not right,
\(mg\) is the force of gravity, \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity.
<li>On page 251, Exercise 4.7.102, the initial velocity should be in terms of
  \(x\) not \(t.\)  That is, it should say:
  \(y_t(x,0) = \sin(\pi x) + 0.1 \sin(2\pi x).\)
<li>On 325 and 326, the hint on exercises 6.5.7 and 6.5.104 has a typo, it
  ends with "\(s \to -\infty\)" but it should say "as \(x \to -\infty\)".
<li>On page 375, in the short example after example 8.4.2, it mistakenly says
  that the trajectory is not a limit cycle.  That is not right, it should
  just say that the trajectories now spiral out.  What does not have a limit
  cycle is \(x'=y,y'=-x.\)
<li>On page 418, in the penultimate step in the computation of the inverse,
  the row 1 column 5 entry is \(\frac{-5}{11}\) when it should be
  \(\frac{-15}{11}.\)  The final step (and thus the inverse matrix) is correct.
<li>On page 435, Exercise A.5.105, the basis given as orthogonal is not
  orthogonal, the last vector is not orthogonal.  This will be changed in the
  next version.
<li>The answer in the back (page 459) to Exercise A.6.102 c) (page 441) is
  not complete, it is both \(3\) and \(-3 .\)
</ol>

<p>
<b>December 19th 2024 edition (version 6.8):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>The answer in the back (page 449) for Exercise 1.7.102 part c (page 62) has a typo, there should be just two factors listed, 0.5 and 0.5, since it is the factor from the first to second, and from second to third.
<li>The answer in the back (page 449) for Exercise 1.7.104 part c (page 62) has a small typo, it refers to \(y(2)\) but should say \(y(1)\).
The numerical answer is correct.
<li>On page 106, the expression that is labeled with the underbrace as \(y_p\) should
be \(A \cos (2x) + B \sin (2x)\) and not \(A \cos (2x) + 2B \sin (2x) .\)  The rest of the computation is correct.
<li>On page 124, in the first paragraph of 3.1.4,
the system should be \(x'=2y-x,\) \(y'=x.\)
Thanks to George Ballinger.
<li>The answer in the back (page 451) for Exercise 3.6.101 (page 161) has a typo, the last term in the
solution (the particular solution) should be 
\(\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}
-1 \\ 1/2 \\ -1/3
\end{smallmatrix}\right]
\cos (2t).\)
<li>The answer in the back (page 452) for Exercise 3.9.104 (page 188) has a typo.
The coefficient of \(e^{-\sqrt{6}t}\) should be
\( \frac{1}{140}-\frac{1}{120\sqrt{6}} .\)  It incorrectly has a plus sign.
<li>On page 216, exercise 4.3.10, the expanded series in part b) is not written out correctly,
it should say \(-1 + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{9} + \cdots .\)
<li>On page 220, in the remarks at the bottom of the page about the eigenvalue problems where sine series and cosine
series come from, the second condition in each problem should be \(x(L)=0\) and \(x'(L)=0\) instead of
the incorrect
\(x(L)=L\) and \(x'(L)=L.\)
<li>On page 238, in Example 4.6.2, the
\(\sin(\pi t)\) should be
\(\sin(\pi x)\)
and
\(\sin(2 \pi t)\) should be
\(\sin(2 \pi x).\)  Both in the problem statement
and in the solution.
<li>On page 243, in the paragraph under the wave equation boxed equation,
the \(u_{xx}\) and \(u_{tt}\) should be
\(y_{xx}\) and \(y_{tt}.\)
<li>On page 257, there is a typo in the hint to Exercise 4.8.5, the building block solution should
have a cosine for the t direction, that is,
it should be \(\sin(n x )\cos(n a t ).\)
It also does not need the \(\pi\)
and \(L\) as clearly those cancel here.
<li>Page 284, Example 5.2.1: The coefficient 
\(\frac{4}{5\pi^3 n^3}\) should be 
\(\frac{-4}{5\pi^3 n^3}\) in both of the formulas.
<li>Page 285, Exercise 5.2.102: As stated the initial shape does not satisfy the side conditions for fixed ends,
it should say \(\sin^2(\pi x).\)
<li>On page 302, in the example (new in version 6.8)
just below equation (6.1), the \(e^{-as}\) should just be \(e^{-s}.\)
<li>On page 308, Example 6.3.2, in the computation of the Laplace transform of cosine convolved with sine
there is a sign error in the intermediate step, although the final answer is correct.  There
should be a minus sign in the cosine when the expression is integrated.
<li>On page 313 at the bottom, we're taking the limit \(b \to 0,\) not \(b \to \infty.\)
<li>On page 324, in Example 6.5.3, the reasoning that \(A=0\) is flawed as \(A\) depends on \(s.\)
The example should assume boundedness of the solution and use that to note that \(Y(x)\) is bounded
and take the limit as \(x \to \infty.\)
<li>On page 324, in Example 6.5.3, in the final derivation of \(y,\) the incorrect \(Y(s)\) is plugged in
to the inverse Laplace transform, the final answer in terms of the convolution also has a typo, it is missing
a negative sign.
<li>On page 325, Exercise 6.5.7, assumption of boundedness is missing, as well as the hint
making the same error as Example 6.5.3.  Limit as \(x\) goes to plus or minus infinity should be used.
<li>On page 326, Exercise 6.5.104, the \(y\) given cannot be bounded, so would be too complicated in the
way we are solving (if we fix our error as above).  This exercise will be changed somewhat.
<li>The answer in the back (page 455) for Exercise 7.2.102 (page 341) is not completely correct.  First,
the recurrence relation is for \(k \geq 3,\) not \(k \geq 1.\)  Second, the
expressions for the coefficients of \(x^6,\) \(x^7,\) \(x^8,\) \(x^9,\) \(x^{10}\) are incorrect
both in part a) and part b) (the earlier coefficients are correct).
<li>On page 342, in Example 7.3.1, when the expression for \(y\) is plugged into the equation,
the constant term should be \(-a_0\) rather than \(a_0.\)  The final answer is correct as 
we get \(a_0=0\) either way.
<li>The answer in the back (page 456) for Exercise 8.1.101 part b) (page 356) is not completely correct.
the second equation at \((0,-1)\) should be \(v' = u\) not \(v'=v .\)
<li>On page 357, subsection 8.2.1, when referring to examples 8.1.1 and 8.1.2, the critical points are \((0,0)\)
and \((1,0).\)
<li>On page 362, Example 8.2.4, same error as above, it should say \((1,0)\) and not \((0,1).\)
<li>On page 377, Example 8.4.5, the expression for the divergence
\(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}
+
\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\) is computed correctly, but it is labeled as
\(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}
+
\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} .\)
<li>The answer in the back for Exercise A.1.103 f) should be \(\left[ \begin{smallmatrix} -8 \\ 0 \end{smallmatrix} \right].\)
<li>In subsection A.3.5, on page 418, in the computation of the inverse, three of the intermediate matrices have a typo.  Namely,
the \(\frac{1}{4}\) should be \(\frac{-1}{4}.\)  Every other entry is correct and the final result is correct.
<li>The answer in the back for Exercise A.4.101 e) should show the basis as the vector \(\left[ \begin{smallmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{smallmatrix} \right].\)
<li>On page 434, in Example A.5.5, the \(\operatorname{proj}_{(1,2,-1)}\bigl((0,2,-2)\bigr)\) should say
\(\operatorname{proj}_{(1,2,-1)}\bigl((0,5,-2)\bigr) .\)  In the next line, the initial \((0,1,-1)\) should
be \((0,5,-2).\)  The rest of the computation and the final answer is correct.
<li>The answer in the back for Exercise A.6.103 should be \(\frac{1}{12} .\)
<li>In the table of Laplace transforms in Appendix B, the transform of
\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi t}} \exp\left( \frac{-a^2}{4t} \right)\)
is incorrect.  It should be \(\frac{e^{-a \sqrt{s}}}{\sqrt{s}} .\)
</ol>

<p>
<b>May 15th 2024 edition (version 6.7):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>On page 73 (section 1.9), caption on Figure 1.21 has the incorrect
equation, there should be a plus sign, that is, the equation
should be \(u_t+u_x=0.\)
<li>On page 120, in the last paragraph, the names of the variables are all
jumbled up, it is \(y_1\) and \(y_2\) that are the dependent variables and
\(x\) is the independent variable.
<li>On page 295, in the list of Laplace transforms, in the transform for
\(u(t-a)\) it should say that \(a \geq 0.\)  Similarly for the list
in Appendix B, where all transforms with 
\(u(t-a)\) and \(\delta(t-a)\) require this restriction.
</ol>

<p>
<b>October 26th 2023 edition (version 6.6):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>On top of page 65 the explicit solutions should
be \(y = \pm \sqrt{C-x^2}.\)  The \(C\) was squared by mistake.  (There were two
places where this typo happened and last iteration only one was fixed)
<li>The answer in the back for 1.8.103 part a) has a small typo: the \(=0\) is
missing when writing the "equation".
<li>On page 82 on the computation at the top where it says \(q(z)\) it should say
\(q(x).\)
<li>On page 100 and 101, it says \(x\)-axis, when it should say \(t\)-axis.
<li>The answer in the back for 2.5.104 used \(\log\) instead of \(\ln .\)
<li>On page 176, Exercise 3.8.105, part b the matrix should be
\(\begin{bmatrix} -3 &amp; 4 \\ -6 &amp; 7 \end{bmatrix}.\)  The matrix given (with
-7) is too difficult and was a typo, and the answer in the back is correct
for the above (with 7).  Thanks to Tamás Zsoldos.
<li>On page 217, Exercise 4.3.106, the part f should ask for \(F(-9)\) as it does
in the back of the book, that was what was intended, the -8 is a typo.
Thanks to Tamás Zsoldos.
<li>The solution to Exercise 4.5.104 should have the constant term be
\(\frac{1}{2\pi^2}\) not
\(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}} .\)
Thanks to Tamás Zsoldos.
<li>On page 271, the last equation when computing \(u(0,0)\) the \(\theta\) on
the right hand side should be 0.
Thanks to Tamás Zsoldos.
<li>In the answer in the back for Exercise 4.10.104, the first \(\rho\)
in the denominator should be squared.
Thanks to Tamás Zsoldos.
<li>On page 275, Example 5.1.2, the differential equation is missing the "\(=0\)"
part, it should say "\(y''+\lambda y = 0 .\)"
<li>The answer in the back for Exercise 5.1.101, half the eigenvalues are
missing and they are also not squared as they should be (what's listed are the
square roots).
The correct answer is that \(\lambda_n = \frac{n^2\pi^2}{4},\) \(n=1,2,3,\ldots.\)
For odd \(n,\)
\(y_n = \cos\left(\frac{n\pi}{2} x \right),\)
for even \(n,\)
\(y_n = \sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{2} x \right).\)
Thanks to Tamás Zsoldos.
<li>Some inline exercises are missing from the web version
if they are not in a subsection.
For example Exercise 5.2.1.  See the PDF version to find them.
Thanks to Tamás Zsoldos.
<li>On page 292, Exercises 5.3.6 and 5.3.101 are not what they were intended,
and the solution in the back is incorrect too.  First, the forcing function is a function of
\(t\) and not \(x,\) but mainly if they are defined on the interval \([-1,1]\) then the forcing
frequencies will cause resonance and we explicitly want to avoid that.  In the next version
they will both be changed to use \([-\pi,\pi]\) as the interval.
Thanks to Tamás Zsoldos.
<li>On page 329, in the explanation of the root and ratio tests several of the limits are given as \(n \to \infty\)
while the expression uses \(k\) as the index.
Thanks to Tamás Zsoldos.
<li>In section 7.3, lower case \(r\) is used both for the exponent in the method and
for the third coefficient in the equation.  I will change the coefficients to upper case
letters for next version.
<li>The solution in the back for Exercise 7.3.103 has \((-1)^{-1}\) instead of \((-1)^k .\)
Thanks to Tamás Zsoldos.
<li>The solution in the back for Exercise 8.1.101 parts a and b is incorrect.
Thanks to Tamás Zsoldos.
<li>Exercise 8.4.101 part c is much harder than intended and the solution in the back is incorrect.  If the
\(x'\) is changed to \(x'=xy^2\) it works.  This will be done in the next version.
Thanks to Tamás Zsoldos.
</ol>

<p>
<b>July 18th 2023 edition (version 6.5):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>On bottom of page 63 (first page of 1.8) the explicit solutions should
be \(y = \pm \sqrt{C-x^2}.\)  The \(C\) was squared by mistake.
<li>Exercise 3.1.106 is missing a piece of information making it not make
sense.  What was meant is that the rate from tank 2 back into tank 1 is reduced
to \(r-s,\) otherwise parts c) makes no sense.  That is, the rates are such
that volumes stay constant.  The answer in the back was done with this in mind,
although the answer to part b) also has some typos, the answer for b) should be
\(x_1' = \frac{r-s}{V} x_2 - \frac{r}{V} x_1\) and
\(x_2' = \frac{r}{V} (x_1-x_2) . \)
Thanks to Michael Tran for noticing.
<li>In Example 3.6.3, on top of page 160, the left hand
equation is incorrect: the \(-4\) in the \(K\) matrix
should be \(-6\) or \(-(4+2)\) as it is in Example 3.6.1.
The equation on the right hand side,
after multiplying by \(M^{-1},\) is correct,
so the rest of the example is OK.  
Thanks to Michael Tran.
<li>In Example 6.5.1, all the \(ds\) in the integrals should be \(dt.\)
Thanks to Heber Farnsworth.
</ol>

<p>
<b>November 20th 2022 edition (version 6.4):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>The answer in the back for 1.5.104 is missing a \(\pm\) in front of the square root.
Thanks to Glen Pugh.
<li>In Example 1.8.7, in the final \(F(x,y)\) the absolute value signs are missing
around \(y,\) that is, it should be \(F(x,y) = xy + \ln \lvert y\rvert .\)
In some sense it is not incorrect if one uses the complex logarithm,
but we wish to avoid doing so.
</ol>

<p>
<b>May 6th 2022 edition (version 6.3):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>On page 67, in Example 1.8.5, the end is a bit muddled.  The implicit
solution for \(x\) in terms of \(y\) should really be when talking about
the equation \((x^2+y^2) \, dx + 2y(x+1)\,dy = 0\) and not the given equation.
Thanks to Tai-Peng Tsai and his students.
<li>On page 318, Exercise 6.4.5 is not well stated.  The given impulse response
is not an impulse response.  This will be changed to \(x(t)=t e^{-t}\) in the
next version.
<li>On page 319, Exercise 6.4.103, similarly as above, is not well stated.  The
given impulse response is not an impulse response.  This will be changed to
\(x(t)=e^t \sin(t)\) and the solution sought will be changed to \(Lx=e^t\) in
the next version.  Thanks to Tai-Peng Tsai and his students.
</ol>

<p>
<b>June 9th 2021 edition (version 6.2):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>Exercise 1.1.103 is incorrect.  The equation is undefined at the initial
condition, although formally one may solve the problem and the solution is
continuous up to the initial condition, it is definitely wrong for this level.
I will change the initial condition to \(x(0)=\frac{\pi}{4}.\)
Thanks to Justin Corvino for spotting this.
<li>On page 45, Exercise 1.4.105, the units for area should be "square meters".
Thanks to Justin Corvino for spotting this.
<li>On page 196, in the informal proof of Theorem 6.1.2, in the displayed
equation, the final answer is off by a sign, it should be \(\frac{M}{s-c}.\)
Thanks to Martin Irungu for spotting this.
</ol>

<p>
<b>July 21st 2020 edition (version 6.1):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>Answer in the back for 1.4.105 says the units are \(m^2s\) but they should be
\(m^2/s.\)
<li>Exercise 8.2.101 part c has a typo in the answer.  The point \((0,1)\) is a
source not a saddle.  Thanks to William Meisel.
<li>On page 430, Example A.5.2, we say we want to project \((1,2,3)\)
onto \((3,2,1),\) but what we in fact did was to project \((3,2,1)\) onto \((1,2,3).\)
<li>In Exercise A.5.105, the vectors form an "orthogonal,"
not an "orthonormal" basis.
</ol>

<p>
<b>November 7th 2019 edition (version 6.0):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>On page 254, when showing that the integral of \(G\) from \(L-at\) to \(L+at\) is zero, the argument should be that \(G(v+L)\) is odd as a function of \(v.\)
<li>In the answer in the back for Exercise 8.2.103, the correct formula is \(y=\pm \sqrt{2C-\frac{1}{2} x^4},\) the description
about "closed curves" is still correct.  Thanks to William Meisel.
</ol>

<p>
<b>March 4th 2019 edition (version 5.5):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>On page 114, section 3.2: The definition of reduced row echelon form does
not include the ordering of the rows.  It may be fine for our purposes, but
that's no excuse.  It should include the ordering of the pivot entries: a pivot entry in any row is strictly to the right of
a pivot entry of the row above, and the zero rows come last.
<li>On page 159, example 3.9.2: In the final answer, when the answer is
expressed as a single vector, in the \(x_2,\) the \(2e^{t}\) should come with a
minus sign.  That is, \(x_2 = \frac{e^{-2t}+e^{4t}-2e^t}{3}+\frac{4t-5}{16}.\)
Thanks to William Meisel.
<li>In the answer in the back for Exercise 2.4.102 for part b and c, the dependent variable should be \(I\) not \(x.\)
<li>In the answer in the back for Exercise 3.9.101, replace \(e^{5t}\) by \(e^{9t},\) also there is a missing 4.
Best to just take the solution to be \(x(t) = C_1 e^{9t} + 4C_2 e^{4t} - \frac{18t+5}{54},\)
\(y(t) = C_1 e^{9t} - C_2 e^{4t} + \frac{t}{6}+ \frac{7}{216}.\)  Thanks to Tom Wan and Shishir Agrawal.
<li>In the answer in the back for Exercise 4.5.102, the coefficient is \(\frac{e^{-n}}{3-(2n)^2}\) and not \(\frac{e^{-n}}{3-2n}.\)
</ol>

<p>
<b>October 11th 2018 edition (version 5.4):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>On page 62, Exercise 1.8.102: There is a typo, the coefficient of \(dy\) should be \(\frac{x}{y^2}.\)
That is, the equation is \(\bigl( \frac{\cos(x)}{y^2} + \frac{1}{y} \bigr) \, dx + \frac{x}{y^2} \, dy = 0.\)
The solution in the back is correct, although it is missing parentheses.  In a related typo, some of the \(dx\)s in the solution
should be \(dy\)s.  Thanks to Sonmez Sahutoglu.
<li>On page 173, the units of the angular velocity are given as radians per second squared, they should be radians per second.
<li>On page 248 on first line, the solution should be \(T_n(t)X_n(x)\) not \(T_n(t)X(x).\)
<li>In section 5.2, the discussion of fixed and free ends is missing,
even though these are used in the exercises.  So it should say the following.
Thinking of the left end, if it is hinged then
\(u(0,t) = u_{xx}(0,t) = 0.\)
If the end is free, then
\(u_{xx}(0,t) = u_{xxx}(0,t) = 0.\)
If the end is fixed, then
\(u(0,t) = u_{x}(0,t) = 0.\)
<li>Solution to Exercise 5.2.101 should be \(\sin(\pi x) \cos(2 \pi^2 t).\)
</ol>

<p>
<b>February 22nd 2018 edition (version 5.3):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>On page 118, Example 3.3.1:  In the linearly independent example when we
write down the linear combination we write \(c_3 t^3\) when we mean \(c_3 t^2\) in
the first component.  Though since we immediately find \(c_3=0\) it makes no
difference for the rest of the computation.
</ol>

<p>
<b>November 1st 2017 edition (version 5.2):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>On page 194, Exercise 4.4.2, for the odd extension one needs to
assume \(f(0) = f(L) = 0\) otherwise it's not actually odd.
<li>On page 205, when plugging \(x_p\) into the equation, the second
\(p\) subscript is missing.  It should be \(2x_p'' + 18\pi^2 x_p\) not
\(2x_p'' + 18\pi^2 x.\)
</ol>

<p>
<b>March 21st 2017 edition (version 5.1):</b>
<p>

<ol>
<li>On page 157, at the bottom.  It says take \(\vec{c} = E^{-1} \vec{b},\) but
it should be \(\vec{a} = E^{-1} \vec{b}\) as then we use \(a_1,\ldots,a_n.\)
<li>On page 157, in the boxed equation.  The integral should be with respect to
\(ds\) not with respect to \(dt.\)
<li>On page 174, top of page, it says the whirling string crosses the axis \(k\) times, but it crosses the
axis \(k-1\) times between the endpoints.
<li>On the bottom of page 175 and the top of 176, the two eigenvectors must correspond to different eigenvalues.  The way it is stated would not work
if \(A\) has repeated eigenvalues.
<li>On page 334, At the bottom of the page it says to integrate from 0 to \(\omega_0,\) when that should be \(\theta_0\) (which is the integral we actually compute on the next page).
<li>On page 342, in Poincaré-Bendixson, we say "spirals towards" which is not the right wording if in fact the periodic solution is just a non-spiraling
critical point.  Better say "tends towards".  Just below the theorem
we also forget to mention the possibility of a critical point.
<li>On page 343, Example 8.4.3: the computation of \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+ \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\) is wrong, it is \(-2x+2y.\)  Therefore the two
regions are different and the argument for why there is no limit cycle needs to change.  Basically it follows because on the line where \(-x+y=0,\) the velocity
\((x',y')\) always points into the set \(-x+y \geq 0.\)  So the second paragraph of the example needs to be entirely replaced.
<li>On page 344, Exercise 8.4.103: The computation of the interval in the back was wrong, it is in fact \(-1 &lt; x &lt; 1.\)  Both the problem and the
answer in the back needs to also be adjusted.
(Issue is that \(f_x = 0\) not \(1\)).
<li>On Page 363, Solution to Exercise 7.2.101 (page 309).  The recurrence
relation is actually \(a_k = \frac{-2a_{k-5}}{k(k-1)}\) (the denominator was
missing), so the series given in the back must be adjusted for both parts a)
and b). Thanks to Wesley Snider.
