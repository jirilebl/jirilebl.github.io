<p>
This book is a polished version of my course notes for Math 6283, Several
Complex Variables, given in
Spring 2014, Spring 2016, Spring 2019, and Fall 2023 semesters
at the Oklahoma State University.
There is more material than can fit in a one semester class
to allow for several different versions of the course.
In fact, I did a different selection each semester I taught it.
Quite a few exercises of various difficulty are
sprinkled throughout the text, and I hope a reader is
at least attempting or thinking about most of them.
Many are required later in the text.
The reader should attempt exercises in sequence; earlier exercises
can help or even be required to solve later ones.

<p>
The prerequisites are a decent knowledge of vector calculus,
basic real analysis, and a working knowledge of complex analysis in one variable.
Measure theory (Lebesgue integral and its convergence theorems) is useful,
but it is not essential except in a couple of places later in the book.
The first two chapters and most of the third
are accessible to beginning graduate students after one semester
of a standard single-variable complex
analysis graduate course.
From time to time,
basic knowledge of differential forms is useful, and
in the chapter on varieties
we use some basic ring theory from algebra.
By design, it can replace the second semester of complex analysis,
with the first semester
perhaps taught with my one-variable book
<a href="../ca/">GCCA</a>.

<p>
This book is not intended as an exhaustive reference.
It is simply a whirlwind tour of several complex variables.
See the end of the book
for a list of books for
reference and further reading.  There are also appendices for
a list of one-variable results, an overview of differential forms,
some basic algebra, measure theory, and other bits and pieces of analysis.

<p>
Do let me know if there are typos or errors.  You can email me
at

</script>.

<p>
This book may be modified and customized for a specific
purpose if necessary.  If you do modify the book, make sure to mark it
prominently as such to avoid confusion.  This aspect is also important for
longevity of the book.  The book can be updated and modified even if I happen
to drop off the face of the earth.  You do not have to depend on any publisher
being interested as with traditional textbooks.

<h2 id=toc>Table of contents:</h2>

The book should be able to be ordered through other means than amazon as well.

You can get an archive of the source of the released version on github, look under
<a href="https://github.com/jirilebl/scv/releases">https://github.com/jirilebl/scv/releases</a>,
though if you plan to work with it, maybe best to look at just the latest working version
as that might have any errata or new additions.  Though these might be a work in progress.
Perhaps best is to let me know.
<p>
The main file is
<span class=tt>ca.tex</span>.  I compile the pdf with <span class=tt>pdflatex</span>.  You also want
to run <span class=tt>makeindex</span> to generate the index
and <span class=tt>makeglossaries</span> to generate the glossary of used notation
(and then rerun <span class=tt>pdflatex</span>).
<p>
The github 'master' version is the current working version,
so it will have whatever new changes I make in my tree.
